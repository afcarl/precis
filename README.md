# scythe

scythe is a Python package for genetic algorithm-based abbreviation of questionnaire (or other) measures.

Better documentation is coming soon; for now, take a look at the [example IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/tyarkoni/scythe/master/examples/PPI-R/PPI-R%20abbreviation.ipynb), which provides an overview of scythe functionality and usage.
